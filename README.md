# CrossWay

## Overview
CrossWay is a 4GL built code analysis tool developed by [Wayfare](https://wayfare.ro/) , tailor-made for Progress OpenEdge applications. It helps users visualize and understand the technical and functional ripple effects of code changes using either [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or our own [CrossWay Visualizer](https://wayfare.ro/downloads/crossway/).

A visual representation of how your code changes affect and spread throughout your entire application would be invaluable. CrossWay gathers cross-reference information from a selected suite of files within your 4GL code and also databases structure and produces several graphical outputs that are easy to understand, both technically and functionally.

This visualization is crucial, especially when your applicationâ€™s business model demands strict control over released changes.
